You guys should also be able use this widget if you install the 
[Widgets Plugin](http://automattic.com/code/widgets/). I tested it
briefly and it appeared to work.

WordPress 2.5 users

Beware, if you leave the '**twitter-widget.php**' file in the 'plugins/widgets' 
folder you will erroneously be prompted to 'upgrade' it on the 'Plugins' 
admin screen. I recommend moving the '**twitter-widget.php**' file 
into the 'plugins' folder.
